This project is a Rust banking system with a retro IBM-style TUI. Please prioritize TUI patterns, modular banking logic, and comprehensive tests for all features.

There should be an HTTP interface which allows the usage of banking functionality via external systems.

A database should be used to persist data and should not require a seperate database server. 

There should be all of the standard banking features, such as accounts, transactions, and user management.

Users should be able to login, have credentials, and have a history of their transactions. There should be a profile of user information that can be updated and a particular user may have mutiple accounts and multiple types of accounts.

There should be a modular way of adding new features to the banking system, such as new types of accounts or new types of transactions.

The name of the banking system should be "banksystem-rs".
